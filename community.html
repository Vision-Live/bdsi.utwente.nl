        Building a strong community is paramount in any field, and data science is no exception. Community building fosters knowledge sharing, collaboration, and growth, creating an environment where individuals can thrive and collectively push the boundaries of their expertise.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are numerous existing communities that offer unique perspectives and opportunities for connection. These communities bring together data scientists from diverse backgrounds, experience levels, and specializations, providing a rich tapestry of ideas and insights.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In addition to our broad data science community on Teams, we also curate a list of topical communities tailored to specific areas of data science used in the social sciences. Whether you are interested in machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, or any other niche, there is a community waiting for you. These specialized communities not only offer targeted discussions and resources but also facilitate networking with experts beyond your particular field of application.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By actively participating in these communities, you can leverage the collective intelligence of the data science community, gain valuable insights, and forge meaningful connections. So, don't miss out on the opportunity to join these vibrant communities. Immerse yourself, contribute your knowledge, learn from others, and together let's shape the future of social data science!

            Part of supporting data science in the long term is building a
            community of data scientists and researchers interested in data
            science. Within the community we can share ideas, questions, and
            expertise with eachother.
          </p>
          <p>
            The BDSi Data Science Community is free to join for anyone affiliated
            with the University of Twente, or involved in a research project of
            the University of Twente.

      <h2 id="topical-communities">Topical Communities</h2>
      There are a number of data science related communities active across BMS and the University of Twente.
      
      {% assign communities_sorted=site.communities | sort: "title" %}
      {% for community in communities_sorted %}
      <h3 class="mt-6">{{community.title}}</h3>

      <h2 class="mt-6">Missing a community?</h2>
      <p>Would you like to start a community around data science in your research? We can help get you in touch with
        others doing similar research, and support all the organizational requirements so that you can get right to the
        content. </p>
      <p>Do you know of a community that is (at least somewhat) related to data science at BMS that isn't on the list
        yet? We'd love to add it to the list!</p>

      <p>Please get in touch through <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.contact.email }}">{{ site.data.contact.email }}</a> or come by during our <a
